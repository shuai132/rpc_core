a tiny C++14 rpc library, supports all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android, etc.) and most microchips (
Arduino, STM32, ESP32/ESP8266, etc.)

**Recommend TCP-based implementation: [asio_net](https://github.com/shuai132/asio_net)**

## Introduction

Full-feature rpc frameworks (e.g. `gRPC` and `bRPC`) are very complex and not suitable for use on embedded platforms.

This project offers a lightweight and user-friend rpc library that is better suited for one-to-one rpc calls.
It supports all platforms and a wide range of microchips, including Arduino, STM32, ESP32/ESP8266, and more.

Note:
This library only offers the protocol layer and API, it **does not** include the implementation of the transport layer.
For TCP-based implementation: [asio_net](https://github.com/shuai132/asio_net)

## Features

* Header-Only
* No-Schema
* Support performance-limited platforms including microchips
* Support any connection type (`tcp socket`, `serial port`, etc.)
* High Performance Serialization, support most STL containers and user type
* Serialization plugins implementations for `flatbuffers` and `nlohmann::json`
* Support `co_await`, depend on `C++20` and `asio`, or custom implementation
* Support subscribe async callback, async coroutine, and custom scheduler
* RAII-based `dispose` for automatic cancel request
* Support timeout, retry, cancel api
* Comprehensive unittests

## TCP-based implementations

* C++
    - [asio_net](https://github.com/shuai132/asio_net): based on [asio](https://think-async.com/Asio/#)  
      Support macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android, etc. and can be used on MCUs that support asio, such as ESP32.

* Rust
    - [./rust](./rust): based on [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)  
      Support callback and async/await, details: [README.md](./rust/README.md)

## Requirements

* C++14
* Provide your connection implementation: [connection](include/rpc_core/connection.hpp)  
  NOTICE: complete data packets are required for data transmission, such as `websocket`.  
  If using `tcp socket`, `serial port`, etc., message pack and unpack need to be implemented.
  Or you can use [stream_connection](include/rpc_core/connection.hpp).
* Optional: C++20 (for coroutine api, co_await co_call)

## Usage

* basic usage:  
  notice: both sender and receiver can use `subscribe` and `call` apis

```c++
// receiver
rpc->subscribe("cmd", [](const std::string& msg) -> std::string {
    assert(msg == "hello");
    return "world";
});

// sender
rpc->cmd("cmd")
    ->msg(std::string("hello"))
    ->rsp([](const std::string& rsp) {
      assert(rsp == "world");
    })
    ->call();
// or: rpc->call("cmd", std::string("hello"), [](const std::string& rsp) {});
```

* async response:  
  just use `request_response<>` type, with `scheduler` support

```c++
rpc->subscribe("cmd", [&](request_response<std::string, std::string> rr) {
    assert(rr->req == "hello");
    rr->rsp("world"); // call rr->rsp() when data is ready
}, scheduler);
```

* async call and response using c++20 coroutine:  
  here is an example using asio, custom async/coroutine implementation is supported

```c++
// receiver
rpc->subscribe("cmd", [&](request_response<std::string, std::string> rr) -> asio::awaitable<void> {
    assert(rr->req == "hello");
    asio::steady_timer timer(context);
    timer.expires_after(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    co_await timer.async_wait();
    rr->rsp("world");
}, scheduler_asio_coroutine);

// sender
// use C++20 co_await with asio, or you can use custom async implementation, and co_await it!
auto rsp = co_await rpc->cmd("cmd")->msg(std::string("hello"))->co_call<std::string>();
// or: auto rsp = co_await rpc->co_call<std::string>("cmd", std::string("hello"));
assert(rsp.data == "world");
```

details: [rpc_s_coroutine.cpp](https://github.com/shuai132/asio_net/blob/main/test/rpc_s_coroutine.cpp)
and [rpc_c_coroutine.cpp](https://github.com/shuai132/asio_net/blob/main/test/rpc_c_coroutine.cpp)

* Addition:

1. `msg` and `rsp` support any serializable type, refer to [Serialization](#Serialization).
2. Detailed usages and unittests can be found here: [rpc_test.cpp](test/test_rpc.cpp)
3. There is an example shows custom async
   impl: [rpc_c_coroutine.hpp](https://github.com/shuai132/asio_net/blob/main/test/rpc_c_coroutine.hpp)

## Serialization

High-performance and memory-saving binary serialization.

* api is very simple to use: [include/rpc_core/serialize_api.hpp](include/rpc_core/serialize_api.hpp)
* usage and comprehensive unittest: [test/test_serialize.cpp](test/test_serialize.cpp)
* the design balance cpu and memory usage, and zero-copy if possible.
* std::string is used as inner data container, it's serialize/deserialize is zero-overhead. so, it is recommended to use
  std::string whenever possible, using it to store binary data is also a good choice.

### Why design a new serialization

Fist of all, I want to keep `rpc_core` library standalone, without any dependencies, except for STL.

Moreover, these serialization libraries do not align with my design goals:

* protobuf library is too large for some platforms, and it's Varint, Zigzag, and GZIP will use a lot of cpu.
* msgpack has similarity reason to protobuf.
* flatbuffers serialized data is too large.

Of course, when communicating across languages, it is recommended to use the above serialization libraries!

Finally, it also provides a way to use thirdparty serialization libraries directly, refer
to [Serialization Plugins](#Serialization-Plugins).

### Usage

For example, user data:

```c++
struct Type {
  uint8_t id = 1;
  uint8_t age = 18;
  std::string name = "test";
};
```

json: `{"id":1,"age":18,"name":"test"}`

| json        |  31   |
| flatbuffers |  44   |
| protobuf    |  10   |
| msgpack     |  20   |
| rpc_core    |   8   |

## Serialization Plugins

* [flatbuffers.hpp](include/rpc_core/plugin/flatbuffers.hpp)  
  Supports using types generated by `flatbuffers` directly as message  
  (add the option `--gen-object-api` when using `flatc`)


* [json_msg.hpp](include/rpc_core/plugin/json_msg.hpp)  
  Supports using types supported by [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) directly as message  
  (the `to_json/from_json` rules in `nlohmann/json` need to be satisfied, and use `DEFINE_JSON_CLASS`).


* [json.hpp](include/rpc_core/plugin/json.hpp)  
  A flexible way to use `nlohmann/json`
